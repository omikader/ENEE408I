## Code

The code for this project can be located under the `src/` subdirectory. In it you will find Arduino and Python code. The Arduino code reads in data from the three onboard [Ping sensors](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/microBob/ultra-sonic-ping-sensor-a9c49e) and activates the motors to move the robot in different directions. The Python code introduces computer vision as robot sensor via [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) runs on the [NVIDIA Jetson TX2](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/buy/jetson-tx2). The Python code also interfaces with the onboard Amazon Echo Dot.

## Documentation

Documentation regarding the project's overall [goals and guidelines](docs/project_outline.pdf), along with our [final report](docs/final_report.pdf) can be found under the `docs/` subdirectory.

## Demonstration

A video demonstration of the robot in action can be found under the `demo/` subdirectory. You can also view the demo on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58ssK7U3kx4).
